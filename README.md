# HeadHunterSearch
The task was to create a mini client for the web site hh.ru(it's the most popular advertisment platform in Russia) which allows to make a search request for open vacancies. I was forced to use loaders which don't fit MVP pattern so much, however it works. It supports pagination loading, pull-to-refresh gesture, error and empty view states
